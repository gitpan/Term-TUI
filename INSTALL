MANUAL INSTALLATION

Some people have reported problems with the automatic installation above.
If the above fails, installing manually is very simple.  Just do the
following:

Take a look at the value of @INC in a perl script (run the debugger and
print @INC).  In any of the directories that it lists, create a directory
named Term.  Copy SigFigs.pm to this directory.

In our installation, I have installed TUI as:
        /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Term/TUI.pm

Make sure that in your perl script you have the line:
        use Term::TUI;


You can also create the man page using the command:
        pod2man TUI.pm > Term::TUI.3
and install it somewhere in your MANPATH.  I have it in:
        /usr/local/man/man3/Term::TUI.3


Once it is installed, you can run the "runtests" command in the "t"
directory to make sure everything works.

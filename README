Many times, I've wanted to quickly write a nice text-based user interface
around a set of perl routines only to end up writing the full (though
simple) parser and interface to make it nice enough, and friendly enough,
to be usable.

This module creates a simple but powerful text based user interface around
perl routines, adding such features as command line history, command line
editing, and online help (command completion will also be implemented),
while hiding all details of the interface from the programmer.

This module requires that Term::ReadLine be installed.  It will make use
of Term::ReadLine::GNU (tested) or Term::ReadLine::Perl (untested) if
they are installed.

The file "sample.pl" contains the example interface from the man page.
Run it to experiment with how the interface feels.
